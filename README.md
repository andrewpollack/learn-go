# Repo To Learn
Starting to learn a new language can be daunting. I thought it would be fun to create a repo to track my progress, and also be able to look back in X time to see how things have improved :)

## Why Go?
When thinking on new languages to learn, one that keeps coming up for me is Go (or GoLang). I like that it's functionally similar to C, and being a compiled language opens up for new opportunities to learn. Traditionally Python has been my go-to language, so this'll also be a nice way to branch out. Plus, I miss some of the pointer manipulation that Cpp has, and hopefully Go can scratch that itch!

## End Project / Goal
My end project / goal is to use Go to write some sort of backend service. One idea I have is to have a server that can act as an in-memory cache for various clients to GET/SET, and to enforce thread safety throughout. Another idea is to use a framework (such as Gin) to act as a backend for a full-stack app. I may come up with an entirely different project in a bit of time, so it'll be important to stay open to all ideas!
